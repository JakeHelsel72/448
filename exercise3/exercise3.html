        Yep. That's me. You're probably wondering how I got into this situaton (being on a poorly formmated HTML page)
        Well, it all started when I went to my 448 Lab. That's where I was told to make a little profile about myself
        for my fifth lab. I knew I could sit there and mess with the CSS for a while longer to make this a little better
        , but I thought "Man, I'm really hungry and I just want to get the requirements done." So here we are.
